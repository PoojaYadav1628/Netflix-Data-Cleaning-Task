---

## 🪜 Step by Step – What I Did

1. ✅ **Opened the dataset in Excel**  
   - I worked on a sample of 100 rows to keep it simple and fast

2. 🧹 **Filled Missing Data**  
   - Wherever data was blank (like director, country), I wrote `N/A`

3. 🗑️ **Removed Duplicates**  
   - I used Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” feature so that only unique rows stay

4. ✏️ **Renamed the Columns**  
   - I changed all column names to clean names:
     - `show_id` → `Show ID`
     - `title` → `Title`
     - `date_added` → `Date Added`
     - and others…

5. 📅 **Fixed the Date Format**  
   - I used a formula to convert the "Date Added" column into `dd-mm-yyyy` format

6. 💾 **Saved the Cleaned File**  
   - Final file name: `netflix_titles_sample_100_cleaned.csv`
